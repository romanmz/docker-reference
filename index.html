	<h2>Concepts</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Container:</dt>
		<dd>Base of the application, everything inside is virtualized and isolated from the host (except the ports and shared resources you define). The <code>Dockerfile</code> file defines what needs to go inside the container.</dd>
		<dt>Service:</dt>
		<dd>In a distributed application there’s often separate pieces that perform different actions (e.g. storing data on the database, converting uploaded videos, streaming data, etc…), each of these pieces is called a “service”. A single service can run one or more containers (all from the same image) by enabling load balancing. The service uses a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to define how many containers it needs and how they need to behave in production.</dd>
		<dt>Task:</dt>
		<dd>Each individual container running in a service is called a “task”, every time the service performs an action it could be run by a different task from the same service.</dd>
		<dt>Swarm:</dt>
		<dd>A swarm is a cluster of multiple machines running the same application through Docker. The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual.</dd>
		<dt>Swarm Manager:</dt>
		<dd>Takes your commands and applies them to all the machines in a swarm. You can specify the logic the swarm manager will use to distribute the containers (equal number, focus on the least busy machines, etc).</dd>
		<dt>Workers:</dt>
		<dd>Extra machines that can join a swarm to help perform tasks (if allowed by the swarm manager).</dd>
		<dt>Node:</dt>
		<dd>Each individual machine running within a swarm.</dd>
		<dt>Stack:</dt>
		<dd>A stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies and can be scaled together. A simple application can have a single stack, more complex apps can use multiple stacks.</dd>
		<dt>Portable image:</dt>
		<dd>The specific OS/runtime, version number, and configuration that will run the application.</dd>
		<dt>Repository:</dt>
		<dd>Collection of images.</dd>
		<dt>Registry:</dt>
		<dd>Collection of repositories.</dd>
